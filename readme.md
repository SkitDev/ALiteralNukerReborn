## 🧠 What Is ALN?

**ALiteralNuker (ALN)** is a full-send Discord nuker wrapped in a slick GUI.  
Capable of mass deletion, spam, flood, and disruption at terminal velocity — it's your one-click shortcut to server chaos 💀

**Don’t ask what it does. Ask what it doesn’t.**

- ✅ **Spam Channel Creation (Customizable)**
- ✅ **Proxy Rotation for Rate Limit Bypass**
- ✅ **Webhook Spammer (Supports File Uploads)**

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### 🔗 Requirements

- 🪟 Windows 10 / 11  
- 🐍 Python 3.x *(for source version)*  
- 🌐 At least 10 working HTTP proxies  
- 💾 [`ALiteralNuker.exe`](skids-are-very.smelly.cc) *(preferred)*

⚠️ Some antivirus programs may flag it — because it’s powerful, not because it’s a rat.  
Disable real-time protection if needed.  
And **test in a VM** if you don’t trust it. I would too.
